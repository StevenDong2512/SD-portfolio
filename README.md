portfolio page 


## Description

The aim of this project was to have a website to showcase my previous work and myself to the potential employer. With the website, it will attract the employer and raise their interests in employing me. 


<!-- - What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn? -->
I have built my own portfolio page by using HTML and CSS files. I have used media query for the CSS file so the content adjust based on the screen size, also by using flexbox, it allowed me to adopt differnt layout for the page content. 


## Installation

1. I added the repo to my local and then created html and css files for me to edit. 
2. I then added three main issues (HTML, Style CSS and Reset CSS).
3. I have divded my whole page into sections and write up HTML and CSS based on each section. 
4. I have then added media query based on different screen sizes so the page is responsive. 
5. Lastly I have used href on tags to hype link between pages and images for the portfolio section. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
