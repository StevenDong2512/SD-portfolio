portfolio page 


## Description

The aim of this project was to have a website to showcase my previous work and myself to the potential employer. With the website, it will attract the employer and raise their interests in employing me. 


I have built my own portfolio page by using HTML and CSS files. I have used media query for the CSS file so the content adjust based on the screen size, also by using flexbox, it allowed me to adopt differnt layout for the page content. 


## Installation

1. I added the repo to my local and then created html and css files for me to edit. 
2. I then added three main issues (HTML, Style CSS and Reset CSS).
3. I have divded my whole page into sections and write up HTML and CSS based on each section. 
4. I have then added media query based on different screen sizes so the page is responsive. 
5. Lastly I have used href on tags to hype link between pages and images for the portfolio section. 

## Usage

For hero section, I have created two differnt layout for screen views by using media queery: 
For desktop, it looks like 
![alt text](./Assets/images/untitled%20folder/About%20big.png)
For smaller screens, it looks like 
![alt text](./Assets/images/untitled%20folder/About%20Small.png)

Moving on to portfolio section, I have also created two different layout:
For desktop, it looks like 
![alt text](./Assets/images/untitled%20folder/Port%20big.png)
For smaller screens, it looks like 
![alt text](./Assets/images/untitled%20folder/Port%20small.png)
Addationally, with the mouse hover on the image, there should be a pop-up window to provide a title for the images, the size of this pop up also increases when hover:
![alt text](./Assets/images/untitled%20folder/Port%20zoom.png)

Then for the contact secion, I have also provided two different layout for different screen sizes: 
For desktop, it looks like 
![alt text](./Assets/images/untitled%20folder/Contact%20big.png)
For smaller screens, it looks like 
![alt text](./Assets/images/untitled%20folder/Contact%20small.png)

Lastly, I have linked the header items to each section on the page so they are responsive when clicks on it.
